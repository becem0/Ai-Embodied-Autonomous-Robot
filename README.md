# Echo — Autonomous Indoor Explorer 🛰️🤖

Echo is a sarcastic, witty, and self-directed autonomous indoor navigation robot built on a **Raspberry Pi 5** and integrated with **ROS 2 Jazzy**. Unlike traditional assistants, Echo is designed as an explorer: it maps its environment, navigates through it, documents what it sees, and gradually connects those abilities to a personality-driven AI layer.

## Current Snapshot — 2026-05-06

Echo now has a working real-world mapping, Nav2 navigation, named-place, and AprilTag action workflow on the `Salle_Hall` map.

* **New map created and saved** as `Salle_Hall`, with runtime files in `~/echo_runtime/maps/Salle_Hall.yaml` and `~/echo_runtime/maps/Salle_Hall.pgm`.
* **Salle_Hall map committed** in `echo_workspace/src/echo_navigation/maps/`.
* **Autonomous navigation launch updated** to use `~/echo_runtime/maps/Salle_Hall.yaml`.
* **Mecanum Nav2 tuning improved** using DWB local planner, mecanum `y` velocity support, practical motor deadband tuning, and relaxed progress checking.
* **AMCL fixed for the new workflow** by disabling the old forced initial pose and switching to `nav2_amcl::OmniMotionModel`.
* **Named places added** in `echo_workspace/src/echo_navigation/config/places.yaml`:
  * `door`
  * `next_to_us`
  * `middle`
* **Place navigation tested** using CLI goals. Echo reaches goals, though mecanum wheel slip can cause delayed replanning.
* **AprilTag 36h11 markers generated and committed** in `echo_workspace/src/echo_navigation/apriltags/`.
* **AprilTag place action routing added**:
  * Tag `0` → go to `door`
  * Tag `1` → go to `next_to_us`
  * Tag `2` → go to `middle`
  * Tag `3` → follow tag
  * Tag `4` → stop
* **AprilTag router dry-run verified** for all five tags.
* **Live AprilTag routing tested**, but it currently needs delay/busy-state protection before autonomous use because camera/detector latency can trigger late actions.

Current practical limitations:
AprilTag live actions need safety hardening before regular use: one-shot tag handling, Nav2 busy-state tracking, tag disappearance timeout, and follow-tag stop logic. Camera/AprilTag latency also needs tuning. Navigation itself is working on `Salle_Hall`, but wheel slip remains expected with the mecanum drivetrain.

## Current Snapshot — 2026-04-27

Echo now has a much cleaner real-world mapping and early navigation workflow:

*   **One-command mapping bringup added** with `echo_workspace/src/echo_bringup/scripts/start_echo_mapping.sh`.
*   **YDLIDAR driver vendored into the Echo workspace** so the tuned LiDAR setup is saved with the project instead of only living in `~/ros2_ws`.
*   **LiDAR transform corrected** for Echo's physical mount; the saved tuning uses `base_link -> laser_frame` translation `x=0.0275`, `z=0.160`, with a 180 degree roll.
*   **SLAM laser range matched to the LiDAR** at `10.0 m`, removing the old `12.0 m` mismatch warning.
*   **Clean SLAM map saved and committed** as `echo_workspace/src/echo_navigation/maps/echo_nav_map.yaml`.
*   **Second room map saved locally** as `/home/ahmed/maps/Local_Club.yaml` and `/home/ahmed/maps/Local_Club.pgm`.
*   **Foxglove workflow verified** over `ws://100.95.231.114:8765` for mapping, `/initialpose`, map/costmap viewing, and Nav2 goal testing.
*   **Nav2 successfully loaded the Local_Club map**, AMCL localized after publishing `/initialpose`, and a small Foxglove `/goal_pose` navigation test worked.
*   **Global static costmap verified**: `/global_costmap/static_layer` gives a clean, accurate view of the saved map used by Nav2.

Current practical limitations:
The older notes below are preserved for project history. Some limitations from this snapshot have since been improved by the 2026-05-06 Salle_Hall navigation workflow. Encoder odometry also appears to retain a large accumulated odom offset after restarts, and the robot/front orientation used by initial-pose arrows needs a final frame/model check.

## 🛠 Hardware Manifest

### Core Compute
*   **Brain**: Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM) running Ubuntu 24.04.
*   **Low-Level MCU**: ESP32 Dev Board (CP2102, 30-pin) running combined micro-ROS firmware for motor control, encoder counting, and raw IMU publishing.

### Actuators & Drive
*   **Chassis**: 4WD Mecanum wheel setup for omnidirectional movement.
*   **Motor Drivers**: 2x L298N Dual H-Bridge drivers controlled by the ESP32.
*   **Encoders**: 4x Hall-effect wheel encoders read by ESP32 hardware interrupts and published as signed tick counts.

## 🧠 Software Architecture

### 1. The Nervous System — ROS 2 Jazzy

Echo operates on a distributed node graph:

*   **`esp32_echo_node`**: Combined micro-ROS low-level controller. Subscribes to `/cmd_vel`, drives the 4 mecanum motors through L298N drivers, counts encoders, publishes `/encoders/FL`, `/encoders/FR`, `/encoders/RL`, `/encoders/RR`, and publishes raw IMU data on `/imu/data_raw`.
*   **Motor watchdog**: ESP32 stops all motors if no `/cmd_vel` command arrives for 500 ms.
*   **Encoder publishing**: Verified around 50 Hz using a `millis()`-driven loop and non-blocking executor spin.
*   **IMU publishing**: Verified around 10 Hz on `/imu/data_raw` with calibrated accel/gyro, synchronized micro-ROS timestamps, and covariance values.
*   **`encoder_odometry`**: Pi-side wheel odometry path publishing `/wheel_odom`.
*   **`ekf_filter_node`**: Current stable configuration uses wheel odometry only and publishes `/odometry/filtered` in the `odom` frame.
*   **`slam_toolbox`**: Used for mapping and initial localization during map creation.
*   **`nav2_bringup`**: Runs map server, AMCL, planner, controller, BT navigator, costmaps, and velocity smoother for autonomous navigation.
*   **`ydlidar_ros2_driver_node`**: LiDAR integration on `/scan`.

### 2. Interaction & Perception

*   **`apriltag_detector`**: Real-time visual marker recognition for automated behaviors.
*   **`webrtc_server`**: Low-latency camera stream for remote monitoring.
*   **`wake_word` / `echo_listener`**: Voice interaction using Picovoice Porcupine and ElevenLabs TTS.
*   **`rosboard`**: Web-based ROS 2 telemetry visualization.
*   **RViz2**: Full Nav2 visualization and goal sending from the Windows laptop via VcXsrv/X11.

### 3. Core Libraries

*   **Robotics**: `rclpy`, `slam_toolbox`, `robot_localization`, `micro-ros-agent`, `nav2_bringup`, `tf2_ros`.
*   **Hardware**: `lgpio`, `smbus2`, ESP32 micro-ROS Arduino.
*   **Vision**: `OpenCV`, `pupil_apriltags`, `aiortc`.
*   **Interaction**: `pvporcupine`, `pvrecorder`, ElevenLabs API.

### Communication Layer

*   **ROS transport**: ROS 2 Pub/Sub over DDS.
*   **External bridge**: `rosbridge_suite` WebSocket for browser dashboards and external agents.
*   **Micro-controller transport**: micro-ROS serial between Raspberry Pi 5 and ESP32.

### Runtime Dashboard Layer

Echo now has a lightweight local runtime dashboard layer for Pi + browser control.

Always-on after Pi reboot:

*   **`echo-rosbridge.service`**: starts `rosbridge_server` on `ws://PI_IP:9090`.
*   **`echo-launch-server.service`**: starts the local launch/status/logs API on `http://PI_IP:5050`.

Dashboard-controlled actions currently verified:

*   **Camera + AprilTag stream**: starts the USB camera publisher and AprilTag detector.
*   **Annotated camera topic**: `/apriltag/annotated_image/compressed`.
*   **Foxglove bridge**: starts on demand at `ws://PI_IP:8765`.

Robot-body actions such as mapping, navigation, micro-ROS, LiDAR, EKF, and Nav2 are intentionally disabled in the dashboard config until the robot body is attached.

Runtime files live in `echo_workspace/echo_runtime/`.

The first browser dashboard lives at `echo_workspace/echo_runtime/dashboard/admin.html`.

Detailed setup and API docs are in `echo_workspace/echo_runtime/README.md`.

## 🔬 System Configuration Details

### ESP32 Low-Level Controller

The current controller is bench-verified as of 2026-04-22:

*   **Firmware path**: `firmware/esp32/echo_low_level_controller/echo_low_level_controller.ino`
*   **Node name**: `esp32_echo_node`
*   **Subscriber**: `/cmd_vel` (`geometry_msgs/Twist`)
*   **Publishers**: `/imu/data_raw`, `/encoders/FL`, `/encoders/FR`, `/encoders/RL`, `/encoders/RR`
*   **Rates**: `/imu/data_raw` around 10 Hz and `/encoders/FL` around 50 Hz verified from ROS 2 CLI.
*   **Important workaround**: `rclc_timer` and blocking `rclc_executor_spin_some()` showed around 1 Hz behavior on this stack. The working firmware uses `millis()` scheduling plus `rclc_executor_spin_some(&executor, 0)`.
*   **Motor tests verified**: forward, reverse, strafe, and rotation with correct encoder sign patterns.
*   **Rotation tuning**: `float L = 0.45f` is used so normal `angular.z` commands create enough PWM to rotate instead of only buzzing the motors.

### SLAM, EKF, And Nav2

Echo's current navigation chain is:

```text
ESP32 encoders -> /wheel_odom -> wheel-only EKF -> /odometry/filtered -> odom TF
YDLIDAR -> /scan
Saved map -> Nav2 map_server -> /map
AMCL -> map -> odom
Nav2 planner/controller -> /cmd_vel -> ESP32 motor controller
```

Key decisions from testing:

*   Wheel-only EKF is currently more stable than fusing raw MPU yaw-rate.
*   AMCL publishes `map -> odom` after receiving a valid initial pose.
*   Nav2's Regulated Pure Pursuit controller is currently better suited to Echo than MPPI.
*   Velocity smoother deadband is tuned high enough to overcome the motors' beep zone.
*   The current Salle_Hall test map is committed in `echo_workspace/src/echo_navigation/maps/`, while runtime copies live in `~/echo_runtime/maps/`.

### Nav2 Files

*   **Echo workspace**: `~/.openclaw/workspace/github_echo/echo_workspace`
*   **Mapping launcher**: `echo_workspace/src/echo_bringup/scripts/start_echo_mapping.sh`
*   **Navigation launcher scripts**: `echo_workspace/src/echo_bringup/scripts/start_echo_navigation.sh` and `start_echo_nav2.sh`
*   **Nav2 params**: `echo_workspace/src/echo_navigation/config/nav2_params.yaml`
*   **Committed default map**: `echo_workspace/src/echo_navigation/maps/echo_nav_map.yaml`
*   **Local test map**: `/home/ahmed/maps/Local_Club.yaml`
*   **Foxglove bridge**: `ws://100.95.231.114:8765`

## 📈 Current Project Status

### **✅ Completed**
*   **Phase 12 (Nav2)**: Nav2 installed, launched, tuned, and CLI `NavigateToPose` goals completed.
*   **Phase 13 (AMCL)**: Saved map loaded through Nav2, AMCL active, and `map -> base_link` TF verified.
*   **Phase 14 (Waypoint Navigation)**: Successfully mapped `Salle_Hall` and `Local_Club`. AprilTag detection routes directly to Nav2 destinations via dynamic `locations.json` mapping.
*   **Phase 15 (Orchestration & Dashboard)**: Admin dashboard added with Foxglove integration. Features layered runtime controls (`robot_body`, `localization`, `nav2`) executed safely via a Python `launch_server`. Protected by a custom `login.html` layer enforcing role-based access.
*   **Phase 19 (Voice Interaction)**: Integrated dynamic Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for fluid conversations. High-quality speech synthesis via ElevenLabs API (George voice).
*   **Hardware Stabilization**: Motor and encoder issues resolved. ESP32 Low-Level Controller (micro-ROS) is fully tuned and driving smoothly.
*   **System Services**: Core components (`echo-dashboard`, `echo-launch-server`, `echo-rosbridge`) configured as reliable `systemd` user services starting automatically on boot.

### **⏳ Still In Progress**
*   **OpenClaw AI Brain Integration**: Tie the established Nav2 goals to the high-level OpenClaw Telegram AI so Echo can execute complex multi-step reasoning goals autonomously.
*   **Cloud Orchestration**: Transition from local dashboard to Firebase/TURN server cloud link for remote global control.

## 🖥 RViz From Windows Laptop

RViz2 can be shown on the Windows laptop using VcXsrv over Tailscale.

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\vcxsrv.exe" :0 -multiwindow -clipboard -nowgl -ac
```

Then SSH into the Pi from PowerShell, not VS Code SSH, and run:

```bash
export DISPLAY=100.106.212.8:0.0
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
rviz2 -d /opt/ros/jazzy/share/nav2_bringup/rviz/nav2_default_view.rviz
```

Security note: `-ac` disables X access control, so use it only on the private Tailscale test network.

---

## Foxglove From Browser
Foxglove is the preferred lightweight UI for mapping, quick Nav2 testing, and ROS 2 visualization.

For direct Foxglove testing, connect from the browser to:

```text
ws://100.95.231.114:8765
```

## 🚀 What's Next?

1.  **Verify robot frame orientation** so Foxglove `/initialpose` arrows represent Echo's true forward direction.
2.  **Connect Nav2 goals to the higher-level AI brain** through a safe skill/API layer.
